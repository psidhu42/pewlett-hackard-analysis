### Purpose

Analyze the data and determine how many employees are retiring grouped by their title, and identify employees born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965 who can potentially participate in a mentorship program.

* The title group with the lowest employees up for retirement is Managers, at 2.

* Looking at the "Mentorship Eligibility" table we can see that there are 1,549 employees that qualify for the mentorship program.

### Summary

As employees start to retire, 72,458 rolls will need to be filled. 25,916 Senior Engineers, 24,926 Senior Staff, 9,285 Engineers, 7,636 Staff, 3,603 Technique Leaders, 1,090 Assistant Engineers, and 2 Managers. There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. The current tables however do not provide a break down by department.

A table that breaks down mentorship qualified employees by their department and title, and a table that shows how long an employee has worked in their current position to determine if they could be up for promotion, are a couple suggestions on additional queries or tables.
